// The &self below indicates that the method borrows the object immutably. There are other possible receivers for a method:
//
// * &self: borrows the object from the caller using a shared and immutable reference. The object can be used again afterwards.
// * &mut self: borrows the object from the caller using a unique and mutable reference. The object can be used again afterwards.
// * self: takes ownership of the object and moves it away from the caller. The method becomes the owner of the object. The object will be drop (deallocated) when the method returns, unless itâ€™s ownership is explicitly transmitted.
// * No receiver: this becomes a static method on the struct. Typically used to create constructors which are called new by convention.
